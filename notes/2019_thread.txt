It's time for the 1st annual #tweeprint census! ðŸ¤“ðŸ“Š

Since June of this year, I've been collecting as many neuroscience and neuro-related tweeprints on @tweeprint as I could find. I just analyzed all 251 of them, and wanted to share what I found. (1/n)

-------------------

First up, you might be wondering: What's a #tweeprint? A tweeprint is a twitter thread where someone gives a brief summary of their scientific research, usually with a link to a recent paper. It can be about any topic, but I've focused mostly on neuro-related ones. (2/n)

-------------------

Where are most tweeprinted papers published? 136 of 251 tweeprinted papers were on a preprint server (93 on biorxiv). What really surprised me here though was how many tweeprinted papers were published in higher-impact journals such as nature/cell/elife... (3/n)

-------------------

...For instance, there were tweeprints for TEN papers published in nature neuro (IF: 21), but only ONE published in j neurosci (IF: 6). Why is this? Is it that people are more excited about publicizing their work when it's in a high-impact journal? I'd love to know why. (4/n)

-------------------

One of the best things about tweeprints is it's a way to share your science with a broad range of scientists and non-scientists. And tweeprints get a lot of eyeballs!

The distribution for # likes and RTs was roughly log-normal, with a median of 112 likes and 42 RTs. (5/n)

-------------------

Of course, the more followers you have, the more attention your tweeprint will get. Of users with the 10 most-liked tweeprints, the median number of followers was 7k. (All but two of those users were PIs!) Of all 251 tweeprints, the median was 0.13 likes per follower. (6/n)

Also, please let me know if I have missed your tweeprint! (n/n)
